'''
Remember that plot_trisurf requires 3 vectors? 
Weâ€™re currently stuck with a list of options data and days to expiration, so we need to unlist the options data, 
get the data we want (strike and implied volatility), and since the vectors must be the same length, 
we must extend the list of days to expiration appropriately. 

Currently, in the list of days to expiration, 
each element is unique, but as there are several strikes for each maturity date, we need to create a new list, 
where each unique date is repeated by how many strikes are available for that maturity date.
'''

# create empty lists to contain unlisted data
lStrike = []
lDTE_extended = []
lImpVol = []
for i in range(0,len(lData_calls)):
    # append strikes to list
    lStrike.append(lData_calls[i]["strike"])
    # repeat DTE so the list has same length as the other lists
    lDTE_extended.append(np.repeat(lDTE[i], len(lData_calls[i])))
    # append implied volatilities to list
    lImpVol.append(lData_calls[i]["impliedVolatility"])
    
# unlist list of lists
lStrike = list(chain(*lStrike))
lDTE_extended = list(chain(*lDTE_extended))
lImpVol = list(chain(*lImpVol))

lDTE_extended

'''
Now we can plot the volatility surface

# initiate figure
fig = plt.figure(figsize=(7,7))
# set projection to 3d
axs = plt.axes(projection="3d")
# use plot_trisurf from mplot3d to plot surface and cm for color scheme
axs.plot_trisurf(lStrike, lDTE_extended, lImpVol, cmap=cm.jet)
# change angle
axs.view_init(30, 65)
# add labels
plt.xlabel("Strike")
plt.ylabel("DTE")
plt.title("Volatility Surface for $"+ticker+": IV as a Function of K and T")
plt.show()

#Note: Only the 11 closest maturities are included in the plot.
